       "'2 7 / 9 / 2 0 2 16: SAMPLING DISTRIBUTIONS\\nThe probabili ty distribution of a statistic is called its sampling distribution. Typically sample statistics are not ends in themselves, but\\nare computed  in order to estimate the corresponding population parameters. This chapter introduces the concepts of the mean, the\\nstandard deviation, and the sampling distribution of a sample statistic, with an emphasis on the sample mean.\\n6.1: THE MEAN AND ST ANDARD DEVIA TION OF THE SAMPLE MEAN\\n6.2: THE SAMPLING DISTRIBUTION OF THE SAMPLE MEAN\\n6.3: THE SAMPLE PROPOR TION\\n6.E: SAMPLING DISTRIBUTIONS (EXERCISES)\\n7: ESTIMA TION\\n7.1: LARGE SAMPLE ESTIMA TION OF A POPULA TION MEAN\\n7.2: SMALL SAMPLE ESTIMA TION OF A POPULA TION MEAN\\n7.3: LARGE SAMPLE ESTIMA TION OF A POPULA TION PROPOR TION\\n7.4: SAMPLE SIZE CONSIDERA TIONS\\n7.E: ESTIMA TION (EXERCISES)\\n8: TESTING HYPOTHESES\\nIn the sampling that we have studied so far the goal has been to estimate a population parameter . But the sampling done by the\\ngovernment agency has a somewhat different objective, not so much to estimate the population mean as to test an assertion—or a\\nhypothesis—about it, namely , whether it is as large as 75 or not. The agency is not necessarily interested in the actual value mean, just\\nwhether it is as claimed. Their sampling is done to perform a test of hypotheses.\\n8.1: THE ELEMENTS OF HYPOTHESIS TESTING\\n8.2: LARGE SAMPLE TESTS FOR A POPULA TION MEAN\\n8.3: THE OBSER VED SIGNIFICANCE OF A TEST\\n8.4: SMALL SAMPLE TESTS FOR A POPULA TION MEAN\\n8.5: LARGE SAMPLE TESTS FOR A POPULA TION PROPOR TION\\n8.E: TESTING HYPOTHESES (EXERCISES)\\n9: TWO-SAMPLE PROBLEMS\\nPreviously , we treated the questions of estimating and making inferences about a parameter of a single population. In this chapter we\\nconsider a comparison of parameters that belong to two different populations. For example, we might wish to compare the average\\nincome of all adults in one region of the country with the average income of those in another region, or we might wish to compare the\\nproportion of all men who are vegetarians with the proportion of all women who are vegetarians.\\n9.1: COMP ARISON OF TWO POPULA TION MEANS- LARGE, INDEPENDENT SAMPLES\\n9.2: COMP ARISON OF TWO POPULA TION MEANS - SMALL, INDEPENDENT SAMPLES\\n9.3: COMP ARISON OF TWO POPULA TION MEANS - P AIRED SAMPLES\\n9.4: COMP ARISON OF TWO POPULA TION PROPOR TIONS\\n9.5: SAMPLE SIZE CONSIDERA TIONS\\n9.E: TWO-SAMPLE PROBLEMS (EXERCISES)\\n10: CORRELA TION AND REGRESSION\\nOur interest in this chapter is in situations in which we can associate to each element of a population or sample two measurements x and\\ny, particularly in the case that it is of interest to use the value of x to predict the value of y. In this chapter we will learn statistical\\nmethods for analyzing the relationship between variables x and y in this context.\\n10.1: LINEAR RELA TIONSHIPS BETWEEN V ARIABLES\\n10.2: THE LINEAR CORRELA TION COEFFICIENT\\n10.3: MODELLING LINEAR RELA TIONSHIPS WITH RANDOMNESS PRESENT\\n10.4: THE LEAST SQUARES REGRESSION LINE\\n10.5: ST ATISTICAL INFERENCES ABOUT Β ₁\\n10.6: THE COEFFICIENT OF DETERMINA TION\\n10.7: ESTIMA TION AND PREDICTION\\n10.8: A COMPLETE EXAMPLE\\n10.9: FORMULA LIST\\n10.E: CORRELA TION AND REGRESSION (EXERCISES)'"
